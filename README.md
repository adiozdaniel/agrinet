# AGRINET

## Problem Statement:

Farmers, particularly those in rural and underserved regions, face significant barriers in accessing essential agricultural inputs such as high-quality seedlings, fertilizers, breeds and other farming resources. This lack of access not only hampers their ability to adopt best practices in crop production but also limits their overall productivity and economic potential. The absence of quality inputs often results in poor crop yields, increased susceptibility to pests and diseases, and diminished sustainability of farming operations. As a result, farmers struggle to meet the growing demand for food while remaining financially viable, thereby exacerbating food insecurity and undermining rural economic development.

# Frontend

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.5.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
