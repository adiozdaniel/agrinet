# AGRINET

## Problem Statement:

Farmers, particularly those in rural and underserved regions, face significant barriers in accessing essential agricultural inputs such as high-quality seedlings, fertilizers, breeds and other farming resources. This lack of access not only hampers their ability to adopt best practices in crop production but also limits their overall productivity and economic potential. The absence of quality inputs often results in poor crop yields, increased susceptibility to pests and diseases, and diminished sustainability of farming operations. As a result, farmers struggle to meet the growing demand for food while remaining financially viable, thereby exacerbating food insecurity and undermining rural economic development.
